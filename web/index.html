      <dl>
        <dt>What is this?
        <dd>This is a service to transfer files between two computers securely using client-side encryption. The computers need only a modern Web Browser and Internet access.

        <dt>What is "client-side encryption"?
        <dd>Client-side encryption means that the files that you are transferring  are encrypted on your own computer before they are send over the network. 

        <p>
        This means the data is secure not only from computers sniffing the network, but also unreadable by us, by our hosting provider or by anyone who can gain access to our servers.

        <p>
        The only way to decrypt the files is using the passphrase which will not be send over the network.

        <dt>What is the maximum size of the uploaded files?
        <dd>
        The total size of the files may not exceed 500GB after compression. 
        <p>
        However, the upload and encryption speed currently make files larger 
        than a few GB rather painful.

        <p>Encryption speed and upload speed will be improved in the near future.

        <dt>How secure is it?
        <dd>
        The files are encrypted using AES-256 encryption, with a 132-bits (BIP39) random passphrase.

        <p>
        These are high security standards, and cannot be decrypted by any means now, or in the near future.

        <p>Please do not take our word for it, and do your own research.


        <dt>Are the filenames encrypted too?
        <dd>No. Filenames and sizes are stored unencrypted. Only file content is encrypted.


        <dt>Can the files be modified by an attacker?
        <dd>If you use the decryption-in-the-browser feature you can be certain 
        that the files are not modified even if someone were to gain access
        to our servers.
        <p>
        If you use the direct-download feature, and you are transferring 
        multiple files, you should verify that each file is encrypted.

        <p>
        The ZIP-format makes it possible for someone who has gained access to
        our systems to replace files with unencrypted versions, 
        and some ZIP-tools do not warn when this happens.


        <dt>How can trust this service? How do I know the files are really encrypted?

        <dd>This service is Open Source, and the source can be found on 
        <a href="https://github.com/tomasvdw/filetransferencrypted">GitHub</a>

        <p>
        The site is packed in a single file, so you can verify the SHA1 key of 
        this file with the key published on GitHub

        <dt>I have another question...
        <dd>You can contact us at <a href="mailto:info@filetransferencrypted.com">info@filetransferencrypted.com</a>
        <p>
        If you find bug, you can report it on 
        <a href="https://github.com/tomasvdw/filetransferencrypted">GitHub</a>
